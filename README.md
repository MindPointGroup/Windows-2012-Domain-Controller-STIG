# Windows-2012-Domain-Controller-STIG
Ansible role for the Windows 2012 Domain Controller STIG

# WARNING
These do not change GPO. This was written for Ansible 2.0/2.1 and likely requires updates for newer versions.
This role is still a wip and you should be careful before attempting to apply it to any environment.
